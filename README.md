# Introduction to PHP and MySQL

Slides and materials are hosted at [http://gdidetroit.github.io/intro-php-mysql/](http://gdidetrot.github.io/gdi-intro-php-mysql/).

This is a modification of the official Girl Develop It PHP/MySQL curriculum, developed by Sylvia Richardson for the Raleigh/Durham chapter. Additional modifications have been made by Randy Walker to fit the Detroit chapter. The course is meant to be taught in 2 four-hour sessions (2 classes per session). Each of the slides and practice files are customizable according to the needs of a given class or audience.

## Course description

PHP is the language that powers Facebook, Wikipedia, WordPress, and more--in fact, it is the most common server-side language on the web! You can use PHP to build interactive, dynamic websites. We will go over the basics of programming with PHP--variables, functions, loops, and more! We will also show you how to connect your code to a MySQL database. By the end of the class you will have a fully functional PHP website.

### Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS is recommended for this class. You do not need any programming experience.

### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A text editor with syntax highlighting. We recommend [Atom](http://atom.io) (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).
